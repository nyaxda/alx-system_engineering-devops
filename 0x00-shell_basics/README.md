This is a repo that reflects my basics mastery of Shell

The following Scripts serve the following purposes:
1. 1-listit - it displays the contents list of your current directory.

2. 2-bring_me_home - it changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory.

3. 3-listfiles - it displays current directory contents in a long format

4. 4-listmorefiles - it displays current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Use the long format.

5. 5-listfilesdigitonly - it displays current directory contents in long format, with user and group IDs displayed numerically and showing hidden files (starting witn .)

6. 6-firstdirectory - it creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory.

7. 7-movethatfile - it moves the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory.

8. 8-firstdelete - it deletes the file "betty" in the /tmp/my_first_directory

10. 10-back - it changes the working directory to the previous one.

11. 11-lists - ists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.

12. 12-file_type - prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when we will run your script.

13. 13-symbolic_link - it creates a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link should be created in the current working directory.

14. 14-copy_html - it copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory.

17. 102-tree - it that creates the directories welcome/, welcome/to/ and welcome/to/school in the current directory.

18. 103-commas - it lists all the files and directories of the current directory, separated by commas (,), directories ending with a slash. Also, the listing is alpha ordered, except for the directories . and .. which are listed at the very beginning. Only digits and letters are used to sort, digits coming first. Assumption is all the files tested will have atl least one letter or one digit. Additionally, the listing ends with a new line.

19. school.mgc - it is a magic file school.mgc that can be used with the command file to detect School data files. School data files always contain the string SCHOOL at offset 0.
