# 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions

In this directory, the scripts present execute different tasks to show mastery of the following concepts:


Expansions

1. Shell Arithmetic
2. Variables
3. Shell initialization files
4. The alias Command

Some of the commands learned are:
 - printenv
 - set
 - unset
 - export
 - alias
 - unalias
 - .
 - source
 - printf

## The following scripts are in this directory:

1.  0-alias - creates an alias.
2.  1-hello_you - prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user.
3.  2-path adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.
4. 3-paths - counts the number of directories in the `PATH`.
5. 4-global_variables - lists environment variables.
6. 5-local_variables - lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
7. 6-create_local_variable - creates a new local variable named  `BEST` and whose value is `School`
8. 7-create_global_variable - creates a new global variable named  `BEST` and whose value is   `School`
9. 8-true_knowledge - prints the result of the addition of 128 with the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`, followed by a new line.
10. 9-divide_and_rule - prints the result of `POWER` divided by `DIVIDE`, followed by a new line.
11. 10-love_exponent_breath - displays the result of  `BREATH`  to the power  `LOVE`. `BREATH`  and  `LOVE`  are environment variables. The script displays the result, followed by a new line.
12. 11-binary_to_decimal - converts a number from base 2 to base 10. The number in base 2 is stored in the environment variable  `BINARY`. The script displays the number in base 10, followed by a new line
13. 12-combinations - prints all possible combinations of two letters, except  `oo`. Letters are lower cases, from  `a`  to  `z`. One combination per line. The output is alpha ordered, starting with  `aa`. It doesn't print  `oo`. The script file contains maximum 64 characters.
14. 13-print_float - prints a number with two decimal places, followed by a new line. The number is stored in the environment variable  `NUM`.
